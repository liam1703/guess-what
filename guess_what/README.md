# guess_what

    Old vue project just tidied up so that it actually works.
    ToDos:
        Move game logic out of Vue components
        Maybe keep track of score? (Means not forcing a page refresh for new game)
        Currently you can guess words that don't exist
        Use a dictionary api rather than the array of words
